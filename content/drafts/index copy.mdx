## What are PBTs?

PBTs are a way to represent ownership of physical assets online by embedding a chip into the asset.

## How do PBTs work?

1. A chip is embedded into a physical asset
2. Users scan the chip with their phone to claim ownership
3. An onchain record is updated for anyone to verify

## Why use PBTs?

PBTs are useful when users value authenticity.

For example, a luxury watch manufacturer with an online community of collectors can implement the PBT standard to:

- Make it difficult for counterfeiters to sell fake watches
- Disincentivize individuals from pretending to own a watch they don't actually own
- Analyze transactions in secondary markets
- Create novel product experiences

The PBT standard is open. Anyone can implement it for their own products in whatever way they see fit.

## Should I use PBTs?

PBTs add an extra layer of complexity. A simple implementation for a few dozen products is straightforward to manage, but at scale, it can be difficult to keep track of all the chips and have different teams work in parallel.

A few considerations:

- **Cost:** As of November 2025, Arx Research is the only manufacturer of valid chips. A set of 10 of their HaLo chips cost around $200. You can contact them for reduced pricing. A high volume order at a 25% discount would be approximately $15 per chip.
- **Manufacturing:** Chips should be embedded in a way that is easy to scan, yet difficult to remove or tamper with. This will require discussions with your manufacturer if you're not manufacturing the product yourself.
- **Hosting:** The metadata for your PBTs need to be hosted reliably for the foreseeable future.

Questions to ask:

1. "Is my product valuable enough to justify the added cost of chips?"
2. "Can I or my manufacturer embed the chips in my product properly?"
3. "Do I have a way to host the metadata for my PBTs reliably?"

Most importantly, **"Is my use case worth the added complexity of PBTs?"**

If you answer yes to all of these questions, then PBTs are a good fit for your product.

If you're not sure, the rest of this documentation covers these topics in more detail for you to make an informed decision.
