[the Bobu Committee is formed with members of the community](https://x.com/the__eeb/status/1643383536848879618?s=20) to facilitate the proposal process.

The proposal process:

1. A community member expresses interest in creating a proposal to a committee member
2. The committee member relays the interest at the next committee meeting and the committee provides feedback
3. If the community member decides to continue, they create the proposal
4. The committee votes on whether the proposal is ready for the community
5. If the majority approves, a Chiru Lab's employee publishes the proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/s:bobuthefarmer.eth) and [the Bobu website](https://bobu.azuki.com/proposals), makes an announcement in the Azuki Discord, and posts on [Bobu the Bean Farmer's X account](https://x.com/BobuBeanFarmer)
6. The committee helps spread the word and hosts an X Spaces
7. The community votes
8. If approved, the necessary contracts are made by Chiru Lab's legal team based on the proposal's statement of work
9. Contracts are signed
10. Funds are disbursed as work begins
